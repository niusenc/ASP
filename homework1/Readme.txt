1. This folder contains several files. Among these files, mapper.c, reducer.c and combiner.c is written by myself and all these three files are compiled. All other files which are needed are downloaded from  https://github.com/bradfa/tlpi-dist. 

2. For mapper.c, you need  an argument which is the file name. For example, ./mapper input.txt .

3. For reducer.c, each time you can only input one tuple and then press "Enter", then you can continue to input a new tuple. The reducer.c will output the tuple immediately as soon as it realizes there won't be any more tuples that belong to the same user. 

4. For combiner.c, just as the mapper.c, you need an argument which is the file name. For example, ./combiner input.txt .
